/*
 * This is starter code for the Mondrian art assignment. Your task will be to
 * implement the getAllRectangles() method (with additional helper methods / objects
 * as necessary). 
 * 
 * Your solution should be recursive and random.
 * 
 * To generate the image, subdivision should be recursively performed using three
 * methods:
 *   - horizontal split
 *   - vertical split
 *   - both horizontal and vertical splits together (i.e., into four rectangles)
 *    
 * A couple notes on the randomization used to generate the image:
 *   - Split positions are selected randomly in the middle of a rectangle with some portions
 *     of the rectangle near the ends excluded.
 *   - If a rectangle is much wider than it is tall, or taller than it is wide, I didn't allow
 *     it to be split in the dimension that would make it even less square. (In other words, if 
 *     a rectangle was say 2 units wide and only 1 unit tall, I only allowed a horizontal split
 *     and not a vertical one).
 *   - I generated colors by first randomly selecting either white, red, blue or green and then selecting
 *     a random shade of that color if it wasn't white. I chose to color ~70% of the cells white and 
 *     equally distribute the other colors. Choosing colors differently can give a bunch of different
 *     images.
